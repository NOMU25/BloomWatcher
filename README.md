BloomWatcher is an interactive 3D visualization tool built in the Godot Engine that helps users explore and understand large-scale flowering events using satellite data. 
Focused on the Antelope Valley California Poppy Preserve, the prototype visualizes superblooms from 2020 and 2023, 
combining Earth observation imagery from NASA’s Landsat 8/9, ESA’s Sentinel-2, and ground-based GLOBE data.
Users can rotate and zoom around a 3D globe, click on Antelope Valley, and view side-by-side comparisons of bloom intensity and vegetation changes across years. 
The app overlays NDVI-based greenness maps and true-color bloom textures, helping visualize the relationship between seasonal patterns, 
climate conditions, and ecological responses.This project addresses the BloomWatch challenge by transforming complex remote sensing data into an accessible, 
interactive experience. By making bloom dynamics visually engaging and intuitive, it supports education, citizen science participation, 
and improved awareness of how climate change affects global flowering phenology.
